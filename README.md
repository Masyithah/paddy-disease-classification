# Plant Disease Detection Using YOLOv8

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using the YOLOv8 model. The dataset includes images of three plant diseases: Bacterial Blight, Brown Spot, and Blast.

## Steps

### 1. Load and Unzip Dataset
- Mount Google Drive and unzip the dataset.

### 2. Split Dataset
- The dataset is split into training and validation sets for each class.

### 3. Install YOLOv8 and Train Model
- Install the necessary dependencies and train the YOLOv8 model on the dataset.

### 4. Visualize Results
- Plot training/validation loss and validation accuracy.

### 5. Predict on Test Images
- Use the trained model to predict plant diseases on test images.
